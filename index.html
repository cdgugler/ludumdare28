        <p>You are Orange bear. You like bananas, honey, and purple
        bear. You need to get to the exit, but you can't jump! Luckily, your friend Sharpy
        can help pull you to the top, just be careful about getting too close. Grab your
        favorite item (you only get one), and try to make it to the exit. You are
        impulsive, so if you walk by another item you will toss your old item away.</p>
    <p><strong>TLDR;</strong> Click on the screen and the Orange Bear will move towards
        the sharp spiked sprite until the energy bar in the top left is gone.
        Get the bear to the end as fast as possible for the highest score. Speed + least
        mount of destroyed items will award the highest score. Exit while holding the purple
        bear for an even higher score.

        <p><strong>About: </strong>Ugh, I'm tired. This is my first time participating in Ludum Dare. It's 
            also my first experience making an HTML5 game. I used the
            <a href="">Phaser</a> HTML5 game framework, stumbling through learning it
            the entire time. The graphics are a little ugly, I didn't have time to replace the placeholder
            graphics. I had tons of ideas to expand on the idea, but with only 48 hours I'm happy it
            works at all! Find more from me here: <a href="http://www.addlime.com">Addlime</a></p>
